### 🧭 Orientation & Getting Started

<details>
<summary><strong>🧠 Notes from the Dev Team</strong></summary>
<br>

**Task and Purpose**

I built this system to reinforce, refresh, and evaluate my SQL skills through practical, repeatable analysis. Rather than relying on static datasets, I wanted something dynamic — a way to simulate the kinds of data challenges analysts face every day, with full control over volume, structure, and messiness.

**Why build a system and not just a script?**

This tool doesn’t just generate data — it builds a complete relational database simulation. I designed a system to go beyond isolated datasets by embedding referential logic, conditionally required fields, and analytical scenarios into the generation process.

You can see this engine in action in the [SQL Stories Portfolio Demo](https://github.com/G-Schumacher44/sql_stories_portfolio_demo), where I use AI-generated prompts to simulate realistic business scenarios and investigative workflows. This pairing gives me an unlimited sandbox to practice SQL storytelling, data diagnostics, and real-world problem solving — all powered by the datasets generated here.

**Human-readable. YAML-driven. Designed for learning.**

<summary><strong> ✨ Key Simulation Features </strong></summary>
<br>

This generator goes beyond simple row creation by simulating a complete, interconnected e-commerce ecosystem.

- **Full Sales Funnel**: Models the entire customer journey from browsing to purchase. It generates a large volume of `shopping_carts` and then "converts" a small, configurable percentage into `orders`, realistically simulating cart abandonment.
- **Time-Aware Customer Behavior**: Simulates customer return visits over a one-year period. The likelihood of a repeat purchase is tied to `loyalty_tier`, and the time between visits is randomized, creating rich data for cohort analysis.
- **Nuanced Cart Abandonment**: The simulation distinguishes between carts that are abandoned with items still in them and carts that are explicitly emptied by the user, providing deeper insight into user intent.
- **Detailed Cart Lifecycle**: Each cart and cart item now includes `created_at`, `updated_at`, and `added_at` timestamps, allowing for granular analysis of shopping session duration and user behavior within the cart.
- **Dynamic Returns**: The number of returns is not fixed but is generated as a percentage of total orders, ensuring that return volumes scale realistically with sales.
- **Contextual Messiness**: The messiness engine can inject not just random noise but also contextual issues, like biased return reasons based on product category or seasonal sales spikes during holiday months.
- **Channel-Specific Behavior**: Models distinct customer behavior based on their acquisition channel (`signup_channel`), influencing their purchase frequency, return rates, and even product category preferences.
- **Earned Customer Value**: Customer `loyalty_tier` and `clv_bucket` are not pre-assigned but are calculated and "earned" based on their cumulative spending over time, creating a realistic progression of customer value.
- **Long-Tail Churn & Reactivation**: The simulation now includes logic for long-term customer churn and a configurable probability for dormant customers to reactivate after a long period, adding valuable edge cases for analysis.

<summary> 📤 Output Files & SQL Loader Guide</summary> 

#### Expected Data Exports

After running the generator, you'll find in the `output/` folder:
- `orders.csv`, `order_items.csv`, `returns.csv`, etc.
- `load_data.sql` — A ready-to-run script for loading data into Postgres or SQLite.

#### `load_data.sql` (for SQLite)
A script, generated from your YAML table schema, that builds the database from your data.
  - This script includes:
    - `CREATE TABLE` statements with inferred schema
    - `COPY` or `INSERT` statements to populate the tables
  - How to Use load_data.sql
    1. Open your SQL client (e.g., pgAdmin, DBeaver, terminal psql, SQLite CLI).
	2. Connect to your database (Postgres or SQLite recommended).
	3. Run the script:

For SQLite:
```bash
sqlite3 your_database.db < output/load_data.sql
```
>This creates all tables and imports your data — ready for analysis or training.

## 🧪 Testing and Validation Guide

This project includes a comprehensive testing framework to ensure the integrity and quality of the synthetic data. Running these tests is highly recommended, especially after making changes to the configuration or generating new datasets.

For a detailed breakdown of each test suite, see the [**🧪 Testing and Validation Guide**](./TESTING_GUIDE.md).

<details>
<summary>🎯 Test Objectives</summary>

- **Config Integrity:** Ensure the YAML config is correctly structured and all required parameters are present.
- **Data Quality Rules:** Validate linkages (e.g., `order_id` in `returns` exists in `orders`), logic (e.g., refund ≤ order total), and schema expectations.
- **Messiness Audits:** Assess the applied messiness level (e.g., null injection, typos, formatting issues).

</details>

<details>
<summary>🛠️ Running the Tests</summary>

The two primary ways to test the system are:
1.  **Main QA Suite**: This runs automatically with the `ecomgen` command and validates the final data output.
2.  **Pytest Suite**: This is for developers to test the core logic in isolation.

- `test_config_integrity.py` – Confirms all required YAML fields exist
- `test_config_linting.py` – Lints YAML for structure and syntax
- `test_data_quality_rules.py` – Validates core business rules (e.g., referential integrity)

**Run them:**
```bash
pytest src/pytests/
```

</details>
